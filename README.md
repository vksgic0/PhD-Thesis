#=====================Introduction===============#

The thesis entitled as "Statistical Modelling and Analysis of Time-to-Event Data under Bayesian Paradigmaim" aims to model different time-to-event data such as recall-based and competing risks data under the Bayesian paradigm with reference prior approach which facilitates ordering of the parameters. It also extends the work for the joint modelling of competing risks data and longitudinal data with cause-dependent masking.

#===================Summary of Chapters===========#

Chapter 1 highlights the basic concepts related to time-to-event data, competing risks, and computational techniques for estimation under the Bayesian paradigm. 
Chapter 2 stressed on parametric modelling of recall-based data, utilizing the Weibull distribution under the Bayesian paradigm with focus on ordering of parameters. 
Chapter 3 is focused on the modelling of competing risks data along with the estimation of parameters by their inferential ordering based on reference priors. 
Chapter 4 focuses on analysing the competing risks data when there is prior information for some of the parameters but not for the rest of the parameters.
Chapter 5 extends the basic survival model to incorporate longitudinal history of the individuls with a focus on masked competing risk data.

Tools Used: Data Augmentation Techniques, Metropolis Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Methods and Gibbs Sampler.
